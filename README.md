=======
A small GBA emulator inspired by github.com/rileytestut, including various fixes.
iGBA enables you to play Nintendo GameBoy Games on your iOS device, this includes support for iPhone 5 and iPad along with many other iOS devices.

"A fast GBA emulator for the iPhone/iPod Touch based on version 1.8.0 of gpSPhone by zodttd. This version can be installed simply by tapping the button below on your iOS Device, or compiled directly in Xcode and deployed just like any other app. No jailbreak required :)" from Rileystestut app Readme.

Version 1.0 of iGBA

Toggle Speed! From the pause menu, you can now toggle between real game speed and extremely-fast-like-OMG speed, similar to the speed function in VisualBoyAdvance. (Only supported on iPhone 4S+, iPad 2+, and iPod Touch 5th Gen+)
128KB Saves. Upset that you can't save your progress in Pokemon Fire Red, or are you maybe tired of having just a white screen appear for certain games? Worry no longer, these ROMs are now 100% supported!
"Open In…" Support. Now if you're out and about and download a ROM in Safari, you can simply tap "Open In…", select GBA4iOS, and it'll import into the app for you!
No More Pull-To-Refresh. Now, the ROM selection screen will update automatically when you add a ROM through iTunes File Sharing, no need to manually refresh.
Other Features

Save State Support
Can import save states from other emulators (Name them the exact name of the ROM you want it to be a save state for, and append the number slot you want for the save.
